\chapter{Literature review}
The suspension of solids has been investigated very extensively over the years. Pioneering was made by \citet{zwi58}, who provided an empirical dimensionless correlation for the  stirred speed at which solids are just suspended. For this velocity is characteristic that no particle remains stationary on the bottom of a tank for more than one or two seconds.    

Computational fluid dynamics has been extensively used to investigate solid-liquid mixing in agitated tanks during the last several years. Earlier studies have been
