Suspendace pevné fáze v mechanicky míchaných nádobách patří v posledních desetiletích ke značně studovanému jevu. Za průkopníka v této oblasti je označován \citet{zwi58}, jenž vyvinul empirickou korelaci pro výpočet rychlosti otáčení míchadla při které již dochází ke suspendaci. Při této rychlosti žádná částice nezůstává na dně nádoby déle než jednu či dvě sekundy. Také další autoři intenzivně experimentálně studovali mechanizmus suspendace v promíchávaných nádobách \citep{nie68,bal78,arm98}. 

V posledních třech dekádách mnoho výzkumníků obrátilo svoji pozornost k počítačové dynamice tekutin jako k prostředku ke zkoumání procesů probíhajících ve vícefázových systémech. Od té doby technika CFD nabývá na vzrůstající oblibě jako základního nástroje ke studiu tokového pole a distribuce pevných částic v míchaných nádobách. Rané CFD simulace byly pouze zaměřeny na určení rychlostního pole v jednofázových systémech \citep{kre91}. Experimentální metody jako LDV byly používány k určení nutných okrajových podmínek pro modelování pohybu míchadla. Hlavní nevýhodou takto získaných simulací je především jejich úzký vztah se zkoumaným systémem. Další vývoj na poli CFD se zaměřil na vývoj simulačních metod, které by kompletně odstranili tuto závislost na experimentálních datech. Tyto snahy vyústily k tvorbě komplexních technik jako XXX a XXX, které jsou schopny popsat rotaci míchadla bez dalších dodatečných dat.  

Zatímco jednofázové toky v míchaných nádobách byly podrobně zkoumány, jak experimentálně, tak výpočetně. Mnohem méně prací bylo publikováno na téma vícefázového proudění v míchaných systémech. Následující kapitola shrnuje několik významných prací, který byly provedeny za účelem studie suspendace pevné fáze v mechanicky promíchávaných nádobách.
  
\section{Suspendace pevné fáze v míchaných nádobách}
\citet{lju01} simulated the two-phase flow in a vessel agitated by a pitched blade turbine with four blades. The investigated system consisted of a flat-bottomed tank equipped with four equally spaced baffles. A diameter of the vessel was $T=\SI{0.297}{\meter}$ and it was filled with water. Glass particles of diameter \SI{150}{\micro\meter} and \SI{450}{\micro\meter} were used as the solid phase. The authors applied Eulerian-Eulerian approach coupled with the standard \keps{} model for their multiphase simulations. A computational domain contained approximately \num{52000} cells and due to the symmetry of the system, only one quarter of the tank was considered. For the description of the interphase drag force four different correlations of drag coefficient were employed, namely \citet{schi32}, \citet{ish79}, \citet{ihme72} and \citet{bru98}. Moreover the authors estimated influence of additional non drag forces on obtained results. The acquired simulation data were compared with experimental measurements done by phase-Doppler anemometry (PDA). It was found that interphase drag is the dominating force acting on the particles. On the other hand the virtual mass force and the lift force had minor impact on the solution. The turbulent dispersion term exhibited some effect in the region close to the center of the vessel, but in the rest of the tank its effect was negligible. All the drag models, which were tested, gave similar very similar results.

All the drag models, which were tested, gave similar very similar results.

Another way how to simulate suspension of solids is using the Eulerian-Granular multiphase model. This technique was employed by \citet{oshi02} to study the distribution of solids in a stirred tank, where concentration of particles varied from \volproc{0.5} to \volproc{50}. In addition, the authors determined quality of suspension (i.e. standard deviation of concentration), its height and the mixing time in the liquid phase. The investigated system was a cylindrical vessel with a four-bladed pitched blade turbine. Due to simplicity the computational grid was set up as two-dimensional axisymmetric model, which reduced computation time by a significant amount. Turbulence was modeled using the standard \keps{} approach and the granular viscosity was expressed by a correlation designed by \citet{syam93}. The obtained results were in the good agreement with experimental data from literature. However, the inconsistency between the just suspended speed correlation and $N_{js}$ for the evaluated tank was observed. The authors suggested that the difference could be caused by high efficiency of modern impellers together with their low off-bottom clearances during the experiments. Nevertheless, the standard deviation of solids volume fraction was shown to be useful measure of the quality of suspension. 

Solid-liquid simulations of the turbulent flow according to the Eulerian-Lagrangian method were carried out by \citet{derk03}. The author employed large eddy simulation to model suspension of solids in a stirred vessel, which contained a Rushton turbine. The stirred tank had a standard configuration. It consisted of a cylindrical, flat-bottomed, baffled tank with diameter $T=\SI{0.297}{\meter}$. The working fluid was water, whereas glass particles of diameter were used as the solid phase. It is worth noting that concentration of the solids was relatively low (up to \volproc{3.6}). Instead of commercial CFD solvers the author used his own CFD code based on Lattice-Boltzmann method. Simulation results qualitatively corresponded to experimental data provided by \citet{miche03} for the similar solid-liquid system. The absence of the lift and the virtual mass force had no significant impact on concentration profiles. It was observed that only if particle-particle collisions were taken into account, a realistic particle distribution throughout the tank was obtained.

Suspension height is the one of important characteristics of mixed systems. Researchers \citet{mic04} carried out experimental measurements of the suspension height at various agitation speeds in a fully baffled transparent tank. The vessel diameter was $T=\SI{0.19}{\meter}$ and the liquid level was chosen higher then usual to facilitate observation of the particle free region. Silica spheres in the size range \num{212}--\SI{250}{\micro\meter} were used as the solid phase and their amount varied from \volproc{0.45} to \volproc{14.4}. Also CFD simulations of the described system were performed in order to test their ability to properly predict the formation of a clear liquid layer. The Eulerian-Eulerian multiphase model was adopted in conjunction with the sliding mesh method for a Rushton turbine motion. Due to symmetric nature of the system, only half of the vessel was simulated and the created computational domain was made up of \num{52992} hexahedral cells. High turbulent flow was modeled using homogeneous \keps{} approach, where both phases are assumed to share the same values for turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent dissipation. In this work drag coefficient was computed on the basis of well known \citet{schi32} correlation. The conducted experiments showed almost linear dependence between the suspension height and the impeller speed. From obtained results arose that the Eulerian-Eulerian model is able to qualitatively predict the height of suspension cloud. The authors suggested taking particle-particle interactions and free turbulence effect into account to obtain better agreement with experimental results.
