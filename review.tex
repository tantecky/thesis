\chapter{Literature review}
The suspension of solids has been investigated very extensively over the years. Pioneering was made by \citet{zwi58}, who provided an empirical dimensionless correlation for the  stirred speed at which solids are just suspended. For this velocity is characteristic that no particle remains stationary on the bottom of a tank for more than one or two seconds. Also other authors have experimentally studied the mechanism of suspension of solids in agitated vessels \citep{nie68,bal78,arm98}.   

In the last two decades many researchers have turned their attention to computational fluid dynamics in order to gain better understanding of the phenomena that govern the multiphase systems. Since then CFD has been increasingly employed as an essential tool to minutely analyze the entire flow field and the solid particle distribution. The early CFD simulations
